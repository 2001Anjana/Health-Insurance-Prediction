# Health Insurance Prediction Using Neural Network

This project implements a neural network to predict the health insurance costs of a person based on various features. The model takes into account **6 features**, including **3 categorical features**, which are encoded using appropriate techniques. The model achieved an **R-squared score of 0.82**, indicating good performance.

## Features Considered:
- Age
- BMI
- Number of Children
- Smoking Status (Categorical)
- Gender (Categorical)
- Region (Categorical)

## Model Overview:
- The neural network is built using **TensorFlow** and trained to predict health insurance charges based on the input features.
- Categorical features are encoded using suitable encoding techniques.
- Achieved an R-squared score of **0.82**.

## Libraries Used:
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Scikit-learn**: For encoding techniques and performance metrics.
- **TensorFlow**: To build and train the neural network.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Streamlit**: To create an interactive user interface for predicting insurance values.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run insurance_app.py
   ```
4. Enter the required details such as age, BMI, and categorical values like smoking status, gender, and region to get a predicted insurance charge.
